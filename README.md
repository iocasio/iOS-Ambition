# iOS-Ambition

Hello,

"Welcome to Ambition. This app is meant to be a simple goal orientated list app with the addition of some minor aspects designed to give the user a more rewarded experience whenever they finish any task. Through the addition of sounds, text, and even "list item" branding like life changing/not life changing can give the user a more accomplished feeling when completing something. The vision for Ambition is to have a user be able to input a goal, and the app will give suggestions based off what goals the user has in their lists. For example, I put "Become a Mobile App Developer" and the app gives me notifications or maybe when I click on it, suggestions or links to sources describing how I could go about achieving that goal."

iOS - Ambition has slightly deviated from the theme on Android in favor of practicing different design concepts in iOS.
